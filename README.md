# Flood-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
Floods  are  one  of  the  most  frequent  and  severe natural  disasters.
In  addition  to  causing  a  huge economic damage (to the human property) they cause a  substantial  loss  of  human  lives.  It  is  therefore crucial  to  use  all  available  technology,  including Earth observation, in their prevention and mitigation.

Machine  learning  techniques  can  reduce  the  time needed  for  flood  detection  from  optical  satellite images.Satellite  images  were  combined  with  digital  terrain model  (DTM)  and  hydrological  network  to  detect flooded areas. 

Two  different  training samples  were prepared  with certain number of training points  and training  segments,  respectively.  Training  examples  were randomly arranged through the observed area and then machine learning algorithms are applied.
